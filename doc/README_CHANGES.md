Differences from the original submission

This version includes a few small updates made after the initial submission. None of the changes affect the core functionality of the FSM system.

- Added support for resetting variables to their initial values when the FSM is stopped manually.
- Console commands now with a slash prefix (e.g. /run, /clear).
- Log messages were made more consistent and informative, especially in error cases such as build failures.
- Slightly increased spacing between states in the graphical view to improve readability.
- Minor code cleanup, such as removing unused debug output.
