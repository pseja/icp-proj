ICP course final project by xcsirim00, xsovak00, xpsejal00.

Implementation of a tool for visual design, code generation and monitoring of interpreted finite state machines.

All core assignment requirements were fulfilled, including real-time asynchronous communication via  a network protocol, FSM visualization, runtime feedback, representation via XML, C++ code generation. The implementation also provides a solid base for future possible extensions, such as multiple automata support.

For a detailed description of the system architecture and implementation details, see the doc/architecture.pdf document.
